# BasicChessGame
You are required to create a program, which simulates a chessboard and the movements of various types of pieces on the chessboard. Chessboard: The chessboard is an 8 x 8 grid with 64 cells in it. With 8 rows (A, B, C…. H) and 8 columns (1, 2, 3…. 8), each cell can be uniquely identified with its cell number.

Objective of your program: Your program should simulate the movement of each unique chess piece on an empty chessboard. • Input – The input string to your program will be the Type of chess piece and its Position (cell number) on the chessboard. E.g. “King D5” • Output – Once you execute the program, the output will be a string of all possible cells in which the chess piece can move.
 
Sample inputs and outputs:

Input – “King D5” Output – “E5, E6, D6, C6, C5, C4, D4, E4”

Input – “Horse E3” Output – “G4, F5, D5, C4, C2, D1, F1”

Assumption: Assume that the board is empty. This means that the pawn cannot move diagonally. Our expectations: 1.) We expect you to come up with a simple console application in the language of your choice. There is no need for a UI, or a web app. 2.) We are looking for simple, modular and robust design. So focus on your best OO/ functional programming skills.
